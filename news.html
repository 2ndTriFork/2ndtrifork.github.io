            <h2>Thanksgiving Break</h2><br>
            <p>To celebrate Thanksgiving, SWF World will not be updated in the week of Thanksgiving. Updates will start to update normally
      starting on 11/28. Thank You!</p>

            <h2>v1.4 Update</h2><br>
            <p>Another new update! This time the update includes the brand-new genre of flash games, Hacked Games! These can ONLY be found under that category
            and not under home to avoid confusion with it's regular one. The instructions on how to play it are on the box. Also, we added the new
          menu design under SWFMemes and also updtated Memes and the Weekly Event. </p>

            <h2>Why no Unity games are on SWFWorld</h2><br>
            <p>A lot of requests for games in the feedback page are for Unity games, such as Rooftop Snipers, Ping Pong Chaos, and more.
      Unity shut down their Unity Web Player about a year ago, and since then it has been really hard to add Unity Games to websites, making
      it extremely difficult for us to add Unity games. We are still trying to figure out how to add them, so we will tell you once we
      are able to.</p>

          <div id="newsbox">
            <h2>v1.39 Update</h2><br>
            <p>Well here's where all the new updates and articles are going to be located in the future! Since this replaces the patch notes block,
              there's an image slideshow that takes it's place. If you want anything on that slideshow, please tell us in the feedback page!
              So this update mainly focuses on the style of the website.
              We didn't really have any time to add any new games, sorry for that, but we will next update! Oh, and you're probably wondering what the fingerprint is
            on the new menu. Be prepared to find out!</p>
